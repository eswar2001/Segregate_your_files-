# Segregate_your_files-
A simple bash script to segregate all the files in a single directory into different subfolders based on their extension

this script does not work with sub directories as there might be a chance of collision of same file names 

How to use the script:-
->copy the script in the text file and rename it as "a.sh"
->now move a.sh into the directory you want to segregate.
->right click and open git bash here or terminal then use cd to navigate to current directory 
->run "./a.sh" and wait until it completes
